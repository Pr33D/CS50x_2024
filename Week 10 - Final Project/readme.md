  ## App Description
  Taskz is a little task manager including a calender and day overview to stay focussed.

  ## Basic functionality
  - Create an own User Account to have your tasks saved in the database
  - Manage Taskz (Yeah, spelled with a "z") on the Overview page, where all your taskz are listed
    - Check off or uncheck taskz to reactivate
    - Delete taskz, if not needed
  - Add tasks using a simple form

  ## Working with calender
  - directly go to the day of the task, where you can see other tasks on that specific day
  - Monthly calender with up/down functionality, showing tasks of the month

Brainstorm:

- A simplistic Web-Application for a personal ToDo List
  -- Single Line "Buttons", scrollable on Mobile and opening as nearly fullscreen card
  -- Cards as PC Overview (Like Google Notes)

- Using Python + Flask, Javascript, HTML, SCSS -> CSS, SQL
  -- Use of Modules for CSS Darkmode (Themes, Variables)
  -- Use of Modules for Python reusable Helper functions

- Option to set Task for specific time or just date (+ repeat)
  -- Calender Overview for all Tasks on days
  -- Day Overview as List of all Tasks on this day sorted by time
